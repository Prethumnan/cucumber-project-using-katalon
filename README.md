# üõí Automation Practice - E-commerce Website Testing Project

This project contains **Cucumber BDD** (Behavior-Driven Development) automated tests for the **http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php** e-commerce website, developed using **Katalon Studio**.

The tests cover key user flows: **Account Registration**, **Sign-in**, and **Forgot Password** functionality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Katalon Studio**: This project is designed to run within the Katalon Studio environment.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required for running Groovy/Java-based tests.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    ```
2.  Open **Katalon Studio**.
3.  Go to **File > Open Project** and navigate to the cloned directory.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This structure adheres to best practices for a scalable Katalon Cucumber project.

| Folder/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `features/` | Contains **Cucumber Feature Files** (`.feature`). These define the high-level, human-readable test scenarios (Given-When-Then). |
| `scripts/groovy/helper/` | Contains utility classes written in **Groovy/Java**. |
| $\hspace{10pt}$`MessageLoader.java` | Loads success and failure validation messages from property files located in `config/`. |
| $\hspace{10pt}$`UserData.java` | Uses a **Faker** library to generate realistic, unique test data (e.g., email, name) for account creation. |
| `scripts/groovy/stepDefinitions/` | Contains **Step Definition** files (`.groovy`). These link the steps from the `.feature` files to the actual Groovy/Katalon test code. |
| `Keywords/pages/` | Contains custom **Keyword classes** for each page (e.g., `signInPage.groovy`, `registerPage.groovy`). |
| $\hspace{10pt}$*page classes* | Stores and provides access to **Test Objects** using the **Lazy Initialization** pattern for better memory management. |
| `Object Repository/` | Stores the actual, physical **Test Objects** (locators) for all UI elements. |
| `Include/config/` | Contains property files (`.properties`) used to store **expected success and failure messages** for validation, loaded by `MessageLoader.java`. |
| `Test Cases/` | Contains the three main Katalon Test Cases used to execute the specific Cucumber tests: `run forgot password`, `run register`, and `run full signin`. |
| `Test Suites/` | Contains **Test Suites**, including **`My test suite`** which groups all three main test cases for full regression testing. |
| `Reports/` | Stores the final test execution reports generated by Katalon Studio. |

## üß™ Test Coverage

The project focuses on the core user journey flows:

| Feature | Scenarios | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sign-in** | Verify successful login, invalid credentials, and required field validation. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Register** | Verify successful account creation with unique data, and validation for existing accounts/invalid data. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Forgot Password** | Verify the process for requesting a password reset. | ‚úÖ Complete |

## üõ† Design & Implementation Details

### BDD with Cucumber

* **Separation of Concerns**: Test definition (`.feature` files) is separate from test implementation (`stepDefinitions/`).
* **Reusability**: Steps are defined once and reused across multiple scenarios.

### Page Object Model (POM) with Lazy Initialization

* The project uses the **Page Object Model** (POM). Each major page has a corresponding class in `Keywords/pages/`.
* These page classes utilize **Lazy Initialization** (objects are created only when they are first needed) for test objects defined in the `Object Repository/`. This approach ensures efficient resource usage.

### Data Management

* **Test Data Generation**: The `UserData.java` helper class ensures that tests use unique, non-colliding user data every time, crucial for reliable registration testing.
* **Validation Data**: All expected validation messages are externalized in property files (`Include/config/`) and loaded via `MessageLoader.java`. This makes message updates quick and centralized.

## üèÉ Running Tests

### Execute a Single Test Case

1.  Navigate to **Test Cases/**.
2.  Open one of the runner test cases (e.g., `run register`).
3.  Click the **Run** button (usually a green play button) and select the desired browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Execute the Full Suite

1.  Navigate to **Test Suites/**.
2.  Open **`My test suite`**.
3.  Click the **Run** button to execute all included test cases in sequence.

## üìä Viewing Reports

After execution, detailed reports are automatically generated and saved in the **`Reports/`** folder. You can view the reports in Katalon Studio or export them to common formats (HTML, CSV, PDF).
